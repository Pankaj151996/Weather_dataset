# Weather Dataset Analysis:

# Overview

This project explores and analyzes a comprehensive weather dataset to uncover insights about various weather patterns and trends. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key metrics such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of weather behavior over time and across different regions or seasons.

# Features

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers
Normalize and format date/time information
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Statistical summary of weather variables
Identification of trends and seasonal patterns
## Data Visualization:
Time-series plots for temperature, humidity, etc.
Scatter plots and heatmaps to explore correlations between variables
## Insights & Forecasting:
Analysis of daily, monthly, and yearly weather trends
Potential for building basic forecasting models using historical data

# Technologies Used

Python: Main programming language for the analysis
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running the analysis
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting
(Optional) Scikit-learn: For any predictive modeling or machine learning tasks
